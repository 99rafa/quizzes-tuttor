#### Rationale

End-to-End tests allowed us developers to push code without worrying about breaking things.Thanks to E2E tests, we are capable of assuring that all the integrated pieces of our application function and work together as expected, inclunding catching errors that we missed during the first 2 parts of the project as well as to improve them. Furthermore, we run these tests as frequently as possible to provide feedback and to ensure that our system remains clean.

#### Rationale
End-to-end tests are where the application is full tested from an user point of view. In spite of being significantly more expensive, they are really relevant to test the most frequent use cases and to assess some mundane details that can escape in more narrow testing.
