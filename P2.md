### Service profiling

We used the [Async Profiler](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/async-profiler.html).

#### Screenshots of summary reports

![Profiling heap](http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/ist189528/bytesPerMethod.png)


#### Discussion of findings

Through the analysis of the profiler, we find that most of the time the execution is inside the findSubmissionsByStudent method, which was expected since it includes the query to the database. Moreover, in which concerns the jmeter tests, we can highlight that by creating a question and a submission in the same loop cycle (load tests), there were some issues about concurrency which made us change the level of isolation provided and, consequently, resulting in a lower performance.
